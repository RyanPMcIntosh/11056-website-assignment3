            Usage and exploration were central to the role of Viking boats in the medieval era. Primarily, these vessels, 
            such as longships and knarrs, served as versatile tools for raiding, trade, and exploration across the vast expanse 
            of the North Sea and beyond. Longships, sleek and swift, were the epitome of Viking naval prowess, designed for 
            lightning-fast strikes along coastal settlements, enabling the Vikings to swiftly navigate shallow rivers and reach 
            far-off lands. On the other hand, knarrs, sturdier and broader, facilitated extensive trade networks, carrying goods 
            and resources to and from distant shores, opening up avenues for commerce and cultural exchange. Both types of vessels 
            played a pivotal role in the Viking Age, enabling the Norse people to leave an indelible mark on history through their 
            maritime exploits and voyages of discovery.</p></div>
